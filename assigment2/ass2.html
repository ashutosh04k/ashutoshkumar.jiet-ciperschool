                            Perhaps the most famous flower on the list, the beautiful rose has attained cultural
                            significance around the world and is often used to symbolise love, affection and beauty.

                            Ranging from blooms as small as a fingernail to the majestic Grandiflora, there are
                            thousands of
                            different cultivations of roses available in rich colours and fragrances.

                            The scientific name comes from the Latin rosa: an easy one to remember!</p>

                            Tall, majestic and strikingly-shaped: lilies are a popular choice for bouquets due to their
                            unusual shape and scent. Like roses, lilies are an important cultural and literary device
                            and
                            are known throughout the temperature Northern Hemisphere for their beauty and resilience.

                            If it's got Lilium in the name then you know the flower is a "true lily"; many flowers which
                            you
                            think share similar characteristics to lilies and even use the term in their common name
                            aren't
                            actually part of the same group. Lily of the Valley and the water lily are the most famous
                            examples of this - but the list is long!!</p>

                            an

                            tulips have been seen as a symbol of wealth and abundance through the ages.
                            Now closely associated with Springtime and Easter, they're known in Turkish as lale, a term
                            which when written in Arabic letters shares the same characters as 'Allah', resulting in the
                            flower becoming a holy symbol in many Middle Eastern cultures.</p>

                            Here's one you'd never have guessed! What we commonly call an orchid is actually known as a
                            phalaenopsis, which is the cultivated flower of choice from the family of plants known as
                            Orchidaceae. There are over 28,000 species of orchid family plants, but the phalaenopsis
                            covers
                            about 60 of those and is mainly native to Southern Asia and Queensland.
                            Interestingly, the orchid's scientific name comes from the Greek for "phalaena-like" - a
                            term
                            coined for a group of large moths. They're said to resemble them in flight, which is why
                            you'll
                            sometimes hear these called "moth orchids"</p>
